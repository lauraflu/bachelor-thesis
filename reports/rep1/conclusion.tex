The report presented the way in which a custom out-of-tree GNU Radio module can
be created in order to be used with a ConnexArray machine and, subsequently,
with the OPINCAA framework. The present code can be used as a base to create
complex kernels that implement signal processing blocks on the SIMD
accelerator.\\

As future improvements, I plan on solving the issue with the QA Python
environment provided by GNU Radio, as it is desirable to have a unit testing
framework rather than building the tests separately and Python is a better
programming language choice for this task than C++. Another thing to do would be
to add the OPINCAA project as a git submodule of the current one, at least until
a better option is available, since the OOT module depends on it for the
simulator.\\
